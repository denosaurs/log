# Log

The denosaurs log module is a tiny, cross-platform, drop-in module for handling
logs using streams. It has been tested and works in the browser, Deno, Node and
Bun with second-class support for all runtimes and environments which implement
[web streams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).
